##Assignment 1 CS547
###Evolving String using Genetic, HillClimbing and RamdomSearch Algorithms
#Description
###This assignment implements the genetic algorithm using population evolution, fitness evaluation, crossover, elitism, tournament selection and mutation. 
###It also implements the hill climbing algorithm using population evaluation, fitness or heuristic function and neighbourhood selection.
###The results of GA is evaluated against the hill climbing and random search algorithms.
