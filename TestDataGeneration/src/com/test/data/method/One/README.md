##Assignment 3 CS547
###Evolving test data using Genetic RamdomSearch Algorithms for Jacobi symbol and Cipolla's algorithm
#Description
###This assignment implements the genetic algorithm using population evolution, fitness evaluation, crossover, elitism, tournament selection and mutation.
###The results of GA is evaluated against the random search algorithm.
###Package One has all the codes for Jacobi's method test data generation
###Package Two has all the codes for Cipolla's method test data generation
